This repository contains the materials for the *A Hands-on in R for Linguists* workshop offered by the [European Master in Lexicography](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/masters/arts-and-humanities/european-master-lexicography) at the [Universidade de Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.gal/en).

This tutorial shows how to get started with R and it specifically focuses on R for analyzing language data but it offers valuable information for anyone who wants to get started with R. As such, this tutorial is aimed at beginners with the aim of showcasing how to set up a R session in RStudio, how to set up R projects, and how to do basic operations using R.

For linguistics I highly recommend [Ladal](https://ladal.edu.au/tutorials.html) tutorials.
